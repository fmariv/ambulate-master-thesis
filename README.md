# Ambulate

This project represents most of my Master's Thesis, which was developed for and in collaboration with the Research Group on Mobility, Transportation and Territory (GEMOTT) of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. 

## Description

Briefly, *Ambulate* is a mobile web app that's capable of collecting real-time data in terms of how the inhabitants ot the city of Barcelona use public space and the feelings they have on it. Thus, the mobile client is capable of both registering and georeferencing the routes that users travel and of showing the user a form about how the space where it is located makes it feel. That form appears either because the user has stopped or because it is in an area of interest, such as a square, a beach or a park. For the purposes of support and monitoring in real time, the GEMOTT research group also have a desktop client in which they can view and even download all the information registered in the database, in a format that allows its analysis by GIS software as, for example, QGIS. Nonetheless, the desktop client code is not included.
